# SemireGPT - Your Custom AI Assistant

## Overview

SemireGPT is a custom AI assistant project that aims to go beyond simple API calls to become a fully-featured, personalized AI system.

## Current Status

🚧 **In Development** 🚧

Currently, this is a starter implementation that demonstrates the basic architecture. The current version uses simple rule-based responses as a placeholder for the future AI implementation.

## Vision

Transform SemireGPT from a basic chatbot into a sophisticated AI with:
- Custom trained models
- Context awareness
- Personalized responses
- Extended capabilities
- Your unique features!

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

```bash
# Python 3.7 or higher
python --version

# Install dependencies (when available)
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running SemireGPT

```bash
# Run the interactive chat
python semire_gpt.py
```

### Basic Commands

- **quit**: Exit the program
- **history**: View conversation history
- **clear**: Clear conversation history
- **save**: Save conversation to file
