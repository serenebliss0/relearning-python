   - Run and read `basics/01_variables_and_types.py`
   - Run and read `basics/02_data_structures.py`
   - Run and read `basics/03_control_flow.py`

2. **Day 4-6: Intermediate**
   - Run and read `intermediate/01_functions.py`
   - Run and read `intermediate/02_classes_oop.py`
   - Run and read `intermediate/03_file_handling.py`

3. **Day 7-9: Advanced**
   - Run and read `advanced/01_decorators.py`
   - Run and read `advanced/02_generators.py`
   - Run and read `advanced/03_context_managers.py`

4. **Day 10+: Build!**
   - Enhance `projects/semireGPT/semire_gpt.py`
   - Add your own features
   - Build something new!

## What Each File Does

### Basics (Start Here!)
- **01_variables_and_types.py**: Variables, numbers, strings, booleans
- **02_data_structures.py**: Lists, dictionaries, tuples, sets
- **03_control_flow.py**: if/else, loops, FizzBuzz

### Intermediate (Core Skills)
- **01_functions.py**: Creating reusable code
- **02_classes_oop.py**: Object-oriented programming
- **03_file_handling.py**: Reading/writing files

### Advanced (Power Features)
- **01_decorators.py**: Function modifiers
- **02_generators.py**: Memory-efficient iteration
- **03_context_managers.py**: Resource management

### Project
- **semireGPT**: Your custom AI assistant starter

## How to Practice

1. **Read the code**: Understand what each line does
2. **Run the file**: See the output
3. **Modify examples**: Change values, break things, fix them
4. **Do exercises**: Complete the practice sections
5. **Build something**: Apply what you learned

## Tips for Success

✅ **Do:**
- Take your time
- Experiment freely
- Make mistakes (they're learning opportunities!)
- Build small projects
- Review concepts regularly

❌ **Don't:**
- Rush through content
- Just copy-paste code
- Skip the exercises
- Give up when stuck
- Try to memorize everything

## Getting Help

- **Python Docs**: https://docs.python.org/
- **Stack Overflow**: For specific questions
- **Reddit r/learnpython**: Community help
- **Real Python**: Tutorials and guides

## Your Goal: SemireGPT

Remember why you're here: to build SemireGPT! 🤖

**Current Status**: Basic conversation with rule-based responses
**Your Vision**: A fully custom AI assistant

**Steps to Get There:**
1. Master Python basics ← You are here!
2. Learn intermediate concepts
3. Understand advanced patterns
4. Study AI/ML concepts
5. Enhance SemireGPT step by step

## Next Actions

Right now:
```bash
# Run this to start
python basics/01_variables_and_types.py
```

After that:
- Complete all basics files
- Try the intermediate files
- Experiment with SemireGPT

## Motivation

> "Sigh, I'm trying to learn Python again..."

You've got this! You already knew Python before, so you're relearning, not starting from scratch. That's actually easier! 💪

Every expert coder started exactly where you are. The difference is they kept going. You will too! 🐍✨
