# Relearning Python 🐍

Welcome to my Python relearning journey! Python was one of the first languages I learned, and now I'm refreshing my skills to build something awesome: **SemireGPT** - my custom AI assistant!

## 🎯 Learning Goals

1. **Master Python Fundamentals**
   - Variables, data types, and operations
   - Data structures and algorithms
   - Control flow and logic

2. **Intermediate Concepts**
   - Functions and functional programming
   - Object-oriented programming
   - File handling and data persistence

3. **Advanced Topics**
   - Decorators and metaprogramming
   - Generators and iterators
   - Context managers and resource management

4. **Build Real Projects**
   - Create SemireGPT (custom AI assistant)
   - Practice with real-world applications
   - Learn AI/ML concepts

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- A code editor (VS Code, PyCharm, etc.)
- Enthusiasm to learn! 🎉

### How to Use This Repository

1. **Start with Basics** (if you're rusty or new)
   ```bash
   python basics/01_variables_and_types.py
   python basics/02_data_structures.py
   python basics/03_control_flow.py
   ```

2. **Move to Intermediate** (once comfortable with basics)
   ```bash
   python intermediate/01_functions.py
   python intermediate/02_classes_oop.py
   python intermediate/03_file_handling.py
   ```

3. **Tackle Advanced** (when ready for deeper concepts)
   ```bash
   python advanced/01_decorators.py
   python advanced/02_generators.py
   python advanced/03_context_managers.py
   ```

4. **Build Your Project** (apply what you've learned)
   ```bash
   cd projects/semireGPT
   python semire_gpt.py
   ```

## 📖 Learning Approach

Each file includes:
- **Clear explanations** of concepts
- **Working code examples** you can run
- **Practice exercises** to reinforce learning
- **Comments** explaining what's happening

### Recommended Study Method:
1. Read through the code and comments
2. Run the file to see the output
3. Modify the examples to experiment
4. Complete the practice exercises
5. Create your own variations

## 🎓 Practice Tips

- **Don't rush**: Take time to understand each concept
- **Experiment**: Modify the code and see what happens
- **Break things**: Errors are learning opportunities
- **Build projects**: Apply concepts to real problems
- **Review regularly**: Come back to earlier topics
- **Have fun**: Enjoy the learning process! 😊

## 💭 Personal Notes

> "Sigh, I'm trying to learn Python again. It actually used to be my most proficient language a few years ago, but now it feels a bit strange."

I'm on this journey to relearn Python and ultimately finish building SemireGPT. Right now it's just an API call to ChatGPT 😭, but with practice and persistence, it'll become something amazing!

**Remember**: Every expert was once a beginner who refused to give up. Let's do this! 💪
