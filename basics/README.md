# Python Basics 🌱

Welcome to the basics section! This is where your Python journey begins (or gets refreshed).

## Files in This Section

### 01_variables_and_types.py
**Topics Covered:**
- Variable assignment and naming
- Basic data types (int, float, str, bool)
- Type checking with `type()`
- Type conversion between different types
- Basic arithmetic operations
- String operations

**Key Concepts:**
- Variables are dynamically typed in Python
- Python has strong typing (won't automatically convert incompatible types)
- f-strings for string formatting

**Run it:** `python 01_variables_and_types.py`

### 02_data_structures.py
**Topics Covered:**
- Lists (mutable, ordered)
- Tuples (immutable, ordered)
- Dictionaries (key-value pairs)
- Sets (unordered, unique elements)
- Common operations for each structure

**Key Concepts:**
- Choose the right data structure for your needs
- Lists for ordered, mutable collections
- Tuples for immutable data
- Dictionaries for key-value lookups
- Sets for unique elements and set operations

**Run it:** `python 02_data_structures.py`

### 03_control_flow.py
**Topics Covered:**
- if/elif/else conditional statements
- for loops (including enumerate)
- while loops
- break and continue statements
- List comprehensions (bonus!)
- Logical operators (and, or, not)

**Key Concepts:**
- Indentation matters in Python!
- Use `for` when you know iterations, `while` for conditions
- List comprehensions are Pythonic and efficient
- FizzBuzz is a classic programming exercise

**Run it:** `python 03_control_flow.py`

## Learning Path

1. **Start Here**: Run each file and read the output
2. **Understand**: Read through the code and comments
3. **Experiment**: Modify values and see what happens
4. **Practice**: Complete the exercises at the end of each file
5. **Create**: Try writing your own examples

## Quick Tips

- **Use the Python REPL**: Type `python` in your terminal to experiment
- **Print everything**: Use `print()` to see what's happening
- **Read error messages**: They're trying to help you!
- **Google is your friend**: Look up things you don't understand

## Next Steps

Once you're comfortable with these basics, move on to the `intermediate/` folder to learn about functions, classes, and file handling.

## Common Beginner Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Forgetting colons**: `if x > 5:` (not `if x > 5`)
2. **Wrong indentation**: Python uses 4 spaces (or consistent tabs)
3. **Comparing with `=` instead of `==`**: `if x == 5` (not `if x = 5`)
4. **Modifying lists while iterating**: Create a copy first
5. **Not reading error messages**: They tell you exactly what's wrong!

## Practice Challenges

After completing all three files, try these:

1. **Calculator**: Create a simple calculator with +, -, *, /
2. **Shopping List**: Build a program to manage a shopping list
3. **Number Guessing Game**: Computer picks a number, user guesses
4. **Word Counter**: Count words and characters in a sentence
5. **To-Do List**: Simple task manager with add/remove/list

**Remember**: Everyone starts here. Take your time and enjoy learning! 🚀
